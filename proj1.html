    <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>Started off by looking at different 
          portfolios on the market, and noting 
          down what I felt did and didn't work. 
        </p>
      <h3>Sketching</h3>
        <p>Sketched out designs before I started working on the HTML and CSS for the website</p>
      <h3>Outlines</h3>
        <p>Started writing the HTML and CSS focusing on creating an outline based on my sketches.</p>
      <h3>Styling</h3>
        <p>Expanding on the CSS that was used to create a the website outline.</p>
      <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>Learned about Javascript in order to add Interactivity to the portfolio.
          This included adding working buttons on the navigation bar, and the resizing 
          project reel on the Home page.
        </p>
      <h3>Finishing the Project</h3>
        <p>After adjusting the CSS and improving on assets I had already made, I put the project to a close.
